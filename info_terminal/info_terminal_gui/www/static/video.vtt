00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.340
Henry is a service robot, currently tested for its capabilities in facilities like the HdB in the context of the STRANDS research project.

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.860
Henry is there to serve you. He can display useful information.

3
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.100
Henry will be roaming about and offer his services.

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.900
Simply press the buttons on his screen,

5
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.460
... to have information displayed to you.

6
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.180
For instance, view the the weather forecast for Vienna,

7
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.300
or read the latest news,

8
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.460
or view today's lunch menu.

9
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:43.540
When you are finished, simply leave Henry behind. He will soon find new tasks to engage with.

10
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.780
Henry also can show visitors and guest around the HdB.

11
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.780
Simply enter the room number or the name of the person to visit,

12
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:07.260
... and be guided by Henry.

13
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.860
This functionality can be be requested by the receptionists, when guest wish to be guided by the robot.

14
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:22.340
On arrival, henry departs and continues with his other duties.

15
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.420
Henry is not remote controlled, but takes its own decisions and drives autnomously.

16
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.380
Also, he decided when it is time to recharge.

17
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.580
Henry sees his environment using cameras and special sensor.

18
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.660
These enable him to see person and obstacles.

19
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.660
Using his sensors, Henry can detect and avoid obstacles.

20
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.060
Henry will always try to give way to humans and not to interfere with them.

21
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.460
Henry is a robot, employed by researchers to study...

22
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.100
how robots can be used effectively and safely in real-world environments such as the HdB.

23
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.700
Henry continuously localises in a map he created.

24
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.420
This enables him to roam freely and offer services where they are needed.

25
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.060
If you have any concerns about the robot, please do not hesitate to contact the STRANDS team or the reception.
